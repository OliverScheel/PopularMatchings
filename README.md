PopularMatchings
================

This repository contains the C# program PopularMatchings which has been written during the course of a bachelor thesis regarding popular matchings.
The folder "Source Code" contains the source files, "Thesis" the thesis in which also the usage of the program is described in the Apendix.
In "Executable" I want to provide an executable, but currently I cannot provide a valid installer for some reason, working on it.
